     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
 
     K-points division:     npool     =       4
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
